# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains all screenshots captured during test execution.

## Directory Structure

```
test-output/screenshots/
├── README.md (this file)
└── [screenshot_name]_[timestamp].png
```

## Screenshot Naming Convention

Screenshots are saved with the following naming pattern:
```
[TestName/StepName]_[yyyyMMdd_HHmmss_SSS].png
```

**Examples:**
- `Failed_Test_Screenshot_Login_Test_20251121_150830_123.png`
- `Application_Launched_20251121_150831_456.png`
- `Credentials_Entered_20251121_150832_789.png`

## Features

✅ **Automatic Screenshot Capture** - Screenshots are captured automatically on test failures and at key steps
✅ **Timestamped Filenames** - Each screenshot has a unique timestamp to prevent overwrites
✅ **Dual Storage** - Screenshots are saved both here and attached to Allure reports
✅ **Organized Structure** - All screenshots in one centralized location for easy access

## Screenshot Locations

### 1. **Standalone Screenshots** (This folder)
   - **Location:** `test-output/screenshots/`
   - **Format:** PNG files with descriptive names and timestamps
   - **Purpose:** Easy access for manual review and debugging

### 2. **Allure Report Attachments**
   - **Location:** `target/allure-results/` (as attachments)
   - **Purpose:** Integrated with test reports for comprehensive test documentation

### 3. **Video Frame Screenshots**
   - **Location:** `test-output/videos/frames_*/`
   - **Purpose:** Individual frames captured during video recording

## Viewing Screenshots

### Option 1: Direct File Access
Navigate to this folder and open PNG files directly:
```bash
cd test-output/screenshots
```

### Option 2: Via Allure Report
Generate and view the Allure report with embedded screenshots:
```bash
allure serve target/allure-results
```

## Configuration

Screenshots are automatically captured:
- ✅ On test failures (via Hooks)
- ✅ At key test steps (via step definitions)
- ✅ When explicitly called using `AllureManager.attachScreenshot()`

## Cleanup

To clean up old screenshots:

**Windows:**
```batch
rmdir /s /q test-output\screenshots
```

**Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
rm -rf test-output/screenshots
```

Or use Maven clean:
```bash
mvn clean
```

## Notes

- Screenshots are captured in PNG format for best quality
- Each screenshot is uniquely named to avoid conflicts
- Failed test screenshots are clearly labeled
- Screenshots are automatically included in CI/CD reports
